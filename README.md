# pyLXR

A very naive implementation of the [LXRHash](https://github.com/pegnet/LXRHash) hashing algorithm used for PegNet's PoW.

Note: map generation is not tested or optimized yet. It is **highly** recommended to just use a prebuilt map from the go implementation linked above.

## Installation

Not on pypi just yet, so just build from source:
```
git clone git@github.com:pegnet/pylxr
cd pylxr && python3 setup.py install
```
